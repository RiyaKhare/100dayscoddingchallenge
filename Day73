// Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 0)
            return 0;
        
        int addIndex = 1; //index that unique characters will be inserted at

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            
            if(nums[i] < nums[i + 1]){ //if true, num[i + 1] is a new unique number
              nums[addIndex] = nums[i + 1];
              addIndex++;
            }

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
