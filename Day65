//Singly linked list 
//Linked List can be defined as a collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory.
//A node contains two fields, i.e. data stored at that particular address and the pointer which contains the address of the next node in the memory.
//The last node of the list contains the pointer to the null.
